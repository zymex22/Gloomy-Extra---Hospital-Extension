# Hospital Extended
![alt text](https://github.com/zymex22/Hospital-Extended/blob/master/About/Preview.png?raw=true "Work in progress")  
(anything in this mod can be changed at anytime before full release)  
  
Idea behind this mod is to make one complete medical / hospital equipment mod.
it will focus on 5 ages:
T0 - Tribal (start / early)
T1 - Medieval (early)
T2 - Industrial Age (mid game)
T3 - Modern (Vanilla style)
T4 - Robotic (tech stuff)
T5 - Spacer (high tech / end game)

### Mod will add:
- Decor items
- Linkables
- Structures
- Items
- Patches/compabilitiy for other medic mods
- Researches relavant

### Sugessted Compatible mods for more extension:
- Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Medical Module
- Harvest organs post mortem
- Medical Training
- Fast Regen

### Mod will not include:
- Medicine
- Drugs
- bodyparts...
All items will be focued around hospital stuff, maybe at some point Psych ward / Assylum too
Inspiration is from mods like: fast regen, medicaddons, life support, medic IV and more.  



## Goal
Original for this mod was making upon my retextures for gloomy vanilla.
But with permission from alot of awesome mod creators i started working on a vanilla style all in one Hospital extension instead.
This mod include alot of great medical mods, and adding some flavour to your hospital.
It still let you choose your own medical mods like Epoe, Ads and such and only adding in linkables and small visuals or options for beds and decors.

so you dont need 10 mods to add abit flavour to hospitals in RW, im really glad so many mod owners thought this would be a good idea too, and i REALLY think you should all go and see what amazing mods they have more.

## Added later (after release)
- more balance
- More mod patches compatibles

All mods that are colab in here will be made incompatible if whole mod is used in here.
Else it will be patches to play nicely with this mod, if only a few items are used like medical iv's
if you want full control of what part of mod to use, i suggest visit originals and add those you want instead.
