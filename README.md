# Gloomy Extra - Hospital Extension
![alt text](http://www.foxbyrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/file-4.jpg "Work in progress")  
(anything in this mod can be changed at anytime before full release)  
  
Idea behind this mod is to make one complete medical / hospital equipment mod.
it will focus on 5 ages:
T0 - Tribal (start / early)(Gloomy style)
T1 - Medieval (early)(Gloomy style)
T2 - Industrial Age (mid game)(Gloomy/Steampunk style)
T3 - Industrial (tech stuff)(Vanilla style)
T4 - Spacer (high tech / end game) (Vanilla style)

### Mod will add:
- Decor items
- Linkables
- Structures
- Items
- Patches/compabilitiy for other medic mods
- Researches relavant
- Mod settings to turn of different tiers. (t1, t2, t3)

### Sugessted Compatible mods for more extension:
- Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Medical Module

### Mod will not include:
- Medicine
- Drugs
- bodyparts...

All items will be focued around hospital stuff, maybe at some point Psych ward / Assylum too


Inspiration is from mods like: fast regen, medicaddons, life support, medic IV and more.  
Theme T0-T2 is made from GloomyLynx Gloomy furniture mod.  
Theme T3-T4 Will be made in vanilla style textures, as gloomy dosent fit spacer stuff.  

## Goal
Goal is this mod will be a All-in-One Medical Equipment mod instead have to  use 3-8 mods for that.  
Will still be dependent of of using mods like EPOE, QEE, Medicine production and such...  
  
Please feel free to contribute to this mod with ideas, work, textures, or other.  
you can open an issue and we will look at it.
